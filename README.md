# dapper - Desktop Applications Autostarter

dapper> is a simple lightweight desktop application auto-starter. It will read
`.desktop` files in the autostart directories, all according to the [FreeDesktop
autostart specifications](http://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html
"Desktop Application Autostart Specification").

You can define which desktop to start applications for (e.g. GNOME, XFCE, etc)
in configuration file (`~/.config/dapper.conf`) or from command line.

Note that autostarting desktop application is probably already taken care of if
you do use a desktop environment/session manager.
