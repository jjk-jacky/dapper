# 01/19/2013, v1.0.0

- Add support of ~ (replaced by $HOME) in Exec and TryExec

- Quoting arguments can now be done using single quote as well

- Fix segfault in failed parsing when .desktop file did not have the "Desktop
Entry" section

- Bump to 1.0.0 as per semantic version rules

# 07/22/2012, v0.1.3

- added information about order & precedence in man page

- when an argument was only a field code, an empty string was sent instead of nothing.
This could lead to unexpected results for some applications (such as file managers or
web browsers, where e.g. new tab could be opened...); fixed.

# 06/21/2012, v0.1.2

- added option --system-dirs, --user-dir and --extra-dir. dapper used to always
process user then system autostart folders. You can now define which ones to
process, including specifying additional folders, as well as in what order.

- parsing fields was actually quite buggy/not working, fixed

# 06/17/2012, v0.1.1

- fixes a crash if the config file couldn't be opened, or a folder to be
processed did not exist

# 06/01/2012, v0.1.0

- first release
